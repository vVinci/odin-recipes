  <h2>How to make Curry Chicken:</h2>
  <p>Wondering how to make curry chicken? This is the recipe that I put together from visiting various websites, verbal
    consultations, and just experimenting on my own and with my family. It's rich and hearty, with flavor that's great
    when you can't get the real thing in the islands. Try a variety of hot peppers to change the flavor â€” even sweet
    bell peppers give it a different taste. Use fresh thyme to really bring out the fresh taste.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      1/4 cup vegetable oil
